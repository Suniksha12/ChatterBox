## Prerequisites
Before setting up ChatterBox, ensure that the following software is installed:
- **XAMPP**: A local server environment that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin. You can download it from [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/).

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install XAMPP
1. Download and install XAMPP from the official site according to your operating system.
2. Make sure to install XAMPP in **C:/Program Files** to avoid potential errors. If you encounter UAC (User Account Control) issues, you can choose another location, but you might need to adjust some settings.

### 2. Start XAMPP
1. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
2. Click the **Admin** button next to MySQL to access phpMyAdmin. Alternatively, you can visit phpMyAdmin directly by typing `localhost/phpMyAdmin` into your web browser.

### 3. Setup Project Files
1. Navigate to the XAMPP installation folder, typically located at:
    ```
    C:/xampp/htdocs/
    ```
2. Copy the ChatterBox project files into the `htdocs` folder. This should include all PHP, JavaScript, and image files.

### 4. Database Configuration
1. Import the `Chatapp.sql` file using phpMyAdmin to set up the required database and tables for the application.
2. Open phpMyAdmin, click on **Import**, and choose the `Chatapp.sql` file from your local system.

### 5. File Structure
- **htdocs/**: Contains all project files.
    - **/php/**: Contains PHP files.
    - **/js/**: Contains JavaScript files for frontend interactions.
    - **/uploads/**: Contains user-uploaded files, including profile pictures and voice messages.
    - **/images/**: Contains default and user-uploaded images.

### 6. Login and Sign-Up Pages
- **Login Page**: Users can log in using their registered credentials. All fields are required.
- **Sign-Up Page**: New users can register by providing their details. Once registered, they can log in and start chatting.

### 7. Main Chat Interface
- After logging in, users will be redirected to the main chat interface. 
- The chat interface displays:
    - **List of active users**: Shows users who are currently online.
    - **Chat area**: Where users can send and receive messages, including voice messages.
    - If no messages have been sent, a message will indicate that the conversation has not started yet.

### 8. Sending Messages
- Users can send text messages, which will be displayed in the chat area.
- If the message is sent from both sides, it will be visible to both users in real-time.
